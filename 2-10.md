## Starting off with the easy version

Counting the total sum of ratings

If we have a look, the only thing that we need to do is to change the movieID and the number 1.

``` python 
from mrjob.job import MRJob
from mrjob.step import MRStep

class RatingsCount(MRJob):
    def steps(self):
        return [
            MRStep(mapper=self.mapper_get_ratings,
                   reducer=self.reducer_count_ratings)
        ]

    def mapper_get_ratings(self, _, line):
        (userID, movieID, rating, timestamp) = line.split('\t')
        yield movieID, 1

    def reducer_count_ratings(self, key, values):
        yield key, sum(values)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    RatingsCount.run()
```

And for the 2nd part, we need to make sure they are sorted.

``` python
from mrjob.job import MRJob
from mrjob.step import MRStep

class RatingsSort(MRJob):
    def steps(self):
        return [
            MRStep(mapper=self.mapper_get_ratings,
                   reducer=self.reducer_count_ratings),
            MRStep(reducer=self.reducer_sorted_ratings)
        ]

    def mapper_get_ratings(self, _, line):
        (userID, movieID, rating, timestamp) = line.split('\t')
        yield movieID, 1

    def reducer_count_ratings(self, movieID, values):
        yield str(sum(values)).zfill(5), movieID

    def reducer_sorted_ratings(self, ratings, movies):
        for movie in movies:
            yield movie, ratings

if __name__ == '__main__':
    RatingsSort.run()
```
