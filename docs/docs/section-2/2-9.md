# Your Challenge

## Sort movies by popularity with hadoop

* Count up ratings given for each movie
    - All you need is to change one thing in the mapper - we don't care about ratings now, we care about movie ID's!
    - Start with this and make sure you can do it
    - You can use VIM/NANO to edit the existing script

## Stretch goal challenge

* Sort the movies by their numbers of ratings
* Strategy:
    - Map to (movieID, 1) key/value pairs
    - Reduce with output of (rating count, movieID)
    - send this to a second reducer so we end up with things sorted by rating count!
* Gotchas:
    - How do we setup more than one MapReduce step?
    - How do we ensure the rating counts are sorted properly?

## Multi-stage jobs

You can chain map/reduce stages together like this:

``` python
    def steps(self):
        return [
            MRStep(mapper=...,
                reducer=...),
            MRStep(reducer=...)
        ]
```

## Ensuring proper sorting

* By default, streaming treats all input and output as strings. So things get sorted as strings not numerically
* There are different formats you can specify. But for now let's just zero-pad our numbers so they'll all sort properly
* The second reducer look like this:

``` python
    def reducer_count_ratings(self, key, values):
        yield str(sum(values)).zfill(5), key
```

## Iterating through the results

``` python
    def reducer_sorted_output(self, count, movies):
        for movie in movies:
            yield movie, count
```
