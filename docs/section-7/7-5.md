# Let's play

* Install phoenix on our hortonworks sandbox
* Mess aroudn with cli
* Setup a user table for MovieLens
* Store and load data through the pig integration

# installation

First we need to make sure that Hbase is running - if it isn't start it.

And now let's ssh in our terminal and change to sudo!

```
yum install phoenix
```

Now phoenix is installed

```
cd /usr/hdp/current/phoenix-client/
ls
cd bin
python sqlline.py
```

Now we have our prompt, and can start exploring

```
!tables
```

Let's start by creating a new table of us cities and their population

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS us_population(
state CHAR(2) NOT NULL, 
city VARCHAR NOT NULL,
population BIGINT
CONSTRAINT my_pk PRIMARY KEY (state,city));
```

Done - let's check and add data

Make sure you don't use INSERT! Phoenix doesn't know what INSERT means... it uses UPSERT.

```
!tables

UPSERT INTO US_POPULATION VALUES ('NY', 'New York', 8143197);
UPSERT INTO US_POPULATION VALUES ('CA', 'Los Angeles', 3844829);

SELECT * FROM US_POPULATION;

SELECT * FROM US_POPULATION WHERE STATE='CA';
```

You can also do more complex stuff like joins, etc.

Now let's clean

```
DROP TABLE US_POPULATION;
!tables
!quit
```

Done!
