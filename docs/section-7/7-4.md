# Apache Phoenix

SQL for HBase...

Conceptually similar to drill - but it ONLY WORKS WITH HBASE and nothing else

If you're just using HBase it might be worth looking at!

* A SQL driver for HBase that supports transactions
* Fast, low-latency - OLDP support
* Originally developed by Salesforce, then opensourced
* Exposes a JDBC connector for HBase
    - Driver for java applications
    - But also can be plugged like tableu, etc, connect to hbase
* Supports secondary indices and user-defined functions
* Integrates with MapReduce, Spark, Hive Pig and Flume

# Why phoenix?

* It's really fast. You probably won't pay a performance cost from having this extra layer on top of HBase
* Why phoneix and not drill?
    - Well, choose the right tool for the job
* Why phonix and not HBase's native clients?
    - Your apps, analytics, may find SQL easier to work with
    - Phonix can do the work of optimizing more complex queries for you
        + But remember HBase is still funcamentally not relational!

# Phoenix Architecture

This is pretty much the HBase architecture

The Phonix client talks to zookeeper -> talk to the Hbase API, then they talk to HBase region server, and a Phoenix co-processor to support what client wants to do.

Zookeeper keeps track of which servers are available

And runs on top of HDFS

# Using Phoneix

* Command Line interface
* Phoneix API for Java
* JDBC driver (Thick client)
* Phoenix Query Server (PQS) (thin client)
    - Intended to eventually enable non-JVM access
* JAR's for MapReduce, Hive, Pig, Flume, Spark

# Let's play

* Install phoenix on our hortonworks sandbox
* Mess aroudn with cli
* Setup a user table for MovieLens
* Store and load data through the pig integration
