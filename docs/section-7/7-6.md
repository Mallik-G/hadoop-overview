# Use the MovieLens data again!

We're going to use the movielens dataset again.

Users table in particular

We'll write a pig script that uses phoenix to write and store our user's data table (or relations in pig lingo) into HBase via Phoenix, and then read it back, and do some queries on it again going through the phoenix layer which should do optimizations between Pig and Hbase.

# Create table

We need to first create the table before.

We'll go back to the commandline interface with 

```
cd /usr/hdp/current/phoenix-client/
python sqlline.py
```

now let's create our user's table with the same schema as the movielens data.

```
CREATE TABLE users (USERID INTEGER NOT NULL, AGE INTEGER, GENDER CHAR(1), OCCUPATION VARCHAR, ZIP VARCHAR CONSTRAINT pk PRIMARY KEY(USERID));

!tables

!quit
```

Now let's go to our home dir ```cd /home/maria_dev```.

And let's make sure that our ml-100k folder has the u.user file, otherwise let's download it:

```
wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/ml-100k/u.user
```

And let's get the pig script

```
wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/phoenix.pig
```

Here is the script

``` pig
REGISTER /usr/hdp/current/phoenix-client/phoenix-client.jar

users = LOAD '/user/maria_dev/ml-100k/u.user'
USING PigStorage('|')
AS (USERID:int, AGE:int, GENDER:chararray, OCCUPATION:chararray, ZIP:chararray);

STORE users into 'hbase://users' using
    org.apache.phoenix.pig.PhoenixHBaseStorage('localhost','-batchSize 5000');

occupations = load 'hbase://table/users/USERID,OCCUPATION' using org.apache.phoenix.pig.PhoenixHBaseLoader('localhost');

grpd = GROUP occupations BY OCCUPATION;
cnt = FOREACH grpd GENERATE group AS OCCUPATION,COUNT(occupations);
DUMP cnt;
```

Now let's run it!

```
pig phoenix.pig
```

Pig runs on MR, so it has an overhead of processing everything. 

If we look closely we can get info on mappers and reducers.

It's actually using hadoop itself, (mr) and HBase.

It all fits together - HDFS, MR, Phoenix, Pig.

We now get the output!

# Cleanup

Now lets clean up

```
cd /usr/hdp/current/phoenix-client/bin
python sqlline.py
```
