# Sqoop export data to MySQL

We now want to export data out from Hive and into MySQL.

First we need to understand where the data is stored in HIVE.

HIVE is only  a schema on read - the data is only stored as a text file somewhere.

HIVE is only adding context when readed.

If we go to the files view, we can see that in hortonworks, it lives under /apps/hive/warehouse/movies

We can see that the data is inside that folder. The file doesn't have any commas, we have it delimitered by TABS.

We're gonna need the path to use sqoop! 

**When exporting data we need to make sure that the table exists already in MYSQL!!!**

```
mysql -u root -p
        hadoop

use movielens;
CREATE TABLE exported_movies (id INTEGER, title VARCHAR(255), releaseDate DATE);
exit
```

Let's type the following command:

```
sqoop export --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/movielens -m 1 --driver com.mysql.jdbc.Driver --table exported_movies --export-dir /apps/hive/warehouse/movies --input-fields-terminated-by '\0001'
```

And it's done! We can check inside mysql

```
use movielens;

SELECT * FROM exported_movies LIMIT 10;

exit
```
