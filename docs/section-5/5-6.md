# Install MySQL and Run Stuff

We're gonna start by logging in to our HDP VM.

We want to access mysql:

``` 
mysql -u root -p
```

Password is hadoop.

Now we run:

```
create database movielens;
show databases;
exit;
```

Now we need to download the MovieLens data using the following command:

```
wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/movielens.sql
```

It's basically a file with a lot of sql. 

Now we need to upload it!

```
mysql -u root -p
        hadoop

SET NAMES 'utf8';
SET CHARACTER SET utf8;
use movielens;
source movielens.sql;
SHOW tables;

SELECT * FROM movies LIMIT 10;

DESCRIBE ratings;

```

We can now try to recreate what we did with HIVE.

```
SELECT movies.title, COUNT(ratings.movie_id) AS ratingCount
FROM movies
INNER JOIN ratings
ON movies.id = ratings.movie_id
GROUP BY movies.title
ORDER BY ratingCount;
```

We have the same answer - it was much faster! Because this dataset is quite tiny... 

If you have real datasets with millions of ratings, it's not as useful, you can cache everything in memory, etc.
