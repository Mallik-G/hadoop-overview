Find Movies with the highest average rating

* Hint: Avg() can be used on aggregated data, like COUNT() does
* Extra credit: only consider movies with more than 10 ratings

Here is my solution:

``` sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS topMovieIDs;
CREATE VIEW topMovieIDs AS
SELECT movieID, 
    COUNT(movieID) as ratingCount,
    AVG(rating) as ratingAvg
FROM ratings
GROUP BY movieID
ORDER BY ratingAvg DESC;

SELECT n.title, ratingAvg
FROM topMovieIDs t JOIN names n
ON t.movieID = n.movieID
WHERE t.ratingCount > 10;
```
