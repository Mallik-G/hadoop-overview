# Zeppelin Advanced 

We can use spark 1.6:

```
ratingsDF.registerTempTable("ratings")
```

We created a table called ratings

```
%sql
SELECT * FROM ratings LIMIT 10;
```

It's great that we can run SQL databases

Let's try another SQL command.

```
%sql
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) as count FROM ratings GROUP BY rating
```

And we can acutally visualise the result by clicking on the histogram.

There are also a lot of plugins with many other visualisations

# IMporting 

``` scala
final case class Movie(movieID: Int, title: String)

val lines = sc.textFile("hdfs://tmp/ml-100k/u.item").map(x => {val fields = x.split('|'); Movie(fields(0).toInt, fields(1))})

import sqlContext.implicits._
val moviesDF = lines.toDF()

moviesDF.show()
```
