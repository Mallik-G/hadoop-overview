# Introducing Pig

A scripting language called pig latin. Built on top of hadoop and Map Reduce.

Allows for writing MR without actually writing them.

# Why Pig?

* Writing mappers and reducers by hand takes a long time
* Pig introduces Pig Latin, a scripting language that lets you use SQL-like syntax to define your map and reduce steps
* Highly extensible with user-defined functions (UDF's)

You might think there are optimisations by writing MR functions, however PIG can now run in TEZ, so it can actually run faster!

You can also have a hybrid of MR and Pig.

# Where is PIG?

Pig sits on top of MR and TEZ, which sits on top of YARN, and then finally at the bottom HDFS.

We can code directly in MR, but it can be a hastle - Pig makes it easier to experiement.

The pig language translates to MR/TEZ, then talks of YARN -> HDFS.

TEZ runs a directly acyclic graph. 

MR has MR->MR->MR

However TEZ looks to interdependencies, and optimises on how to run.

With Tez, things run up to 10 times faster than with MR.

You might be able to run PIG as standalone and not even need a hadoop cluster for a lot of the jobs.

# Running Pig Scripts


## GRUNT 

You can use the CLI **GRUNT**.

If you have a small dataset to experiment, you can use this

## SCRIPT

You can have it from a file and run it on a periodic basis, etc

## Ambari / HUE

This is what we'll be messing with.

# An Example: Find the oldest 5-star movies
