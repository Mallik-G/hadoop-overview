# Challenge: System report

* You work for a big website
* Some manager wants a graph of total numbers of sessions per day
    - Unique users have hit the website for a short period of time
* And for some reason they don't want to use an existing service for this

# Requirements

* Only run daily based on previous day's activity
* Sessions are defined as traffic from same IP address within a sliding one hour window 
* Let's assume your existing web logs do not have session data in them
* Data is only used for analytic purposes internally
    - So no need to bend this data for massive number of hits
    - And manager can wait for data

# How woudl you do it?

* Things to consider
    - A daily SQL query run automatically all you need
    - Query needs some table that contains session data
        + And that will need to be built throughout the day

# Solution

* Apache Kafka
    - Taking all IP addresses
    - Look behaviour for past hour
    - Figure out as come in how many sessions have we seen
    - Kafka is perfect option, more than flume, as server info would be valuable for other people as well
        + This is a very common thing in organisations
* Apache Spark Streaming / 1 hour window 
    - Spark talks to Hive to insert to HDFS
* Use Oozie for the calculations
* Use other tool to visualise on top of Hive

### Something simpler...

* Have an existing databse that updates daily?
* Use Sqoop to get it all!
* In fact you might not even need Hive / HDFS
