# All the other services

Other relevant technologies in brief! 

# Impala

* Cloudera's alternative to Hive
* Massively parallel SQL engine on Hadoop
* Impala's always running, so you avoid the start-up costs when starting a hive query
    - Made for BI-style queries
* Bottom line: Impala's often faster than Hive, but Hive offers more versatility
* Consider using impala instead of Hive if you're using Cloudera

# Accumulo

* Another BigTable clone (like HBase)
* But offers a better security model
    - **Cell based access control**
* And server-side programming
* Consider it for your NoSQL needs if you have complex security requirements
    - But make sure the systems that need to read this data can talk to it

# Redis

* A distributed in-memory data store (like memcache)
* But it's more than cache
* Good support for storing data structures
* Can persist data to disk
* Can be used as a data store and not just a cache
* Popular caching layer for web apps

# Apache Ignite

* An "in-memory data fabric"
* Think of it as alternative to Redis
* But it's closer to a database
    - ACID guarantees
    - SQL support
    - But it's all done in memory

# Elasticsearch

* A distributed document search and analytics engine
* Really populer
    - Wikipedia
    - The Guardian
    - Stack overflow
    - Many more
* Can handle things like real-time search-as-you-type
* When paired with Kibana, great for interactive explorations
* Amazon offers an Elasticsearch service

# Kinesis (and the AWS ecosystem)

* Amazon Kinesis is basically the AWS version of Kafka
* Amazon has a whole ecosystem of its own
    - EMR
    - S3
    - Elasticsearch Service/CloudSearch
    - DynamoDB
    - Amazon RDS
    - ElastiCache
    - AI / Machine Learning services
* EMR in particualr is an easy way to spin up a Hadoop cluster on demand


# Apache NiFi

* Directed graphs of data routing
    - Can connect to Kafka, HDFS, Hive
* Web UI for designing complex systems
* Often seen in context of IoT sensors, and managing their data
* Relevant in that it can be a streaming data source you'll see


# Apache Falcon

* A "data governance engine" that sits on top of Oozie
* Included in hortonworks
* Like NiFi, it allows construction of data processing graphs
* But it's really meant to organise the flow of your data within Hadoop
* Only need this if you have so many workflows that you need a manager for the manager

# Apache Slider

* Deployment tool for apps on YARN cluster
* Allows monitoring of your apps
* Growing / shrinking your deployment as it's running
* Manages mixed configurations
* Star/Stop apps on cluster
* Still incubating...
