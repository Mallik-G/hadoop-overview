# Spark2 Challenge

Filter out movies with very few ratings

## Problem

* Our examples of finding the lowest rated movie were polluted with movies only rated by one or two people
* Modify one or both of these scripts to only consider movies with at least ten ratings

There will be 2 solutions. One that uses the RDD interface, and one that uses the Spark2 interface.

For the RDD solution, we would just have to insert:

``` python
popularTotalsAndCount = ratingTotalsAndCount.filter(lambda x: x[1][1] > 10)
```

For the spark solution, we can simply use:

``` python
popularAverageAndCounts = averagesAndCounts.filter("count > 10")
```
