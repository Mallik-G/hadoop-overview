# MongoDB Shell

Now we'll use the shell with mongodb. To do that we open our terminal, and type:

```
mongo
```

In the interactive mongo shell now we can query our data:

``` javascript
use movielens

// Very javascript-y function
db.users.find( { user_id: 100 } )

// Now we can do more exploration in that query
db.users.explain().find( { user_id: 100 } )

// We can see that all is doing is a COLSCAN, going one record at a time until it finds it
// To fix this we can make an index
// The 1 stands for ascending
db.users.createIndex( { user_id: 1 } )

// Now let's do the same explain plan again
db.users.explain().find( { user_id: 100 } )

// Now instead of an index scan, its finding the query
// let's try it again
db.users.find( { user_id: 100 } )
```

If you forget to add a key, your database is going to be extremely slow.

# Cool / complex stuff to do

There are things that you would need hadoop to do, but you can do it in mongo.

Answer the question of : what is the average age of X?

``` javascript
db.users.aggregate([
    { $group: { _id: { occupation: "$occupation", avgAge: { $avg: "$age"}}}}
])
```

We can see that it finished extremely fast, giving us the average age per occupation.



``` javascript
// We can also find out how many users in db.
db.users.count()

// Collections
db.getCollectionInfos()

// Now let's drop it
db.users.drop()

// Let's check if we cleaned
db.getCollectionInfos()
```

Now let's make sure that we shut down mongo gracefully, otherwise we'll be introuble.

In the Ambari interface we go to Services > MongoDB, and press **Actions>Stop**.

If stops successfully we'll be able to safely quit everything!
