# Apache Mesos

Like YARN, it's a resource negotiator, but much broader

It's a bit of a tangent as it's not directly relevant to hadoop, but it's common.

# What is Mesos?

* Came out of Twitter - it's a system that manages resources across your data center(s)
* Not just for big data stuff - it can allocate resources for we servers, small scripts, whatever
* Meant to solve a more general problem than YARN - it's really a general container management system

# We're kind of going off the reservation

* Mesos isn't really part of the hadoop ecosystem per se, but it can play nice with it
    - Spark and Storm may both run on mesos instead of YARN
    - Hadoop YARN may be integrateed with Mesos using Myriad
        + So you don't necessarily need to partition your data center between your hadoop cluster and everything else!

# Differences between Mesos and YARN

* YARN is a monolithic scheduler - you give it a job, and YARN figures out where to run
* Mesos is a two tiered system
    - Mesos just makes offers of resources to your application ("Framework") 
    - Your framework decides whether to accept or reject them 
    - You also decide your own scheduling algorithm
* YARN is optimised for long, analytical jobs like you see in Hadoop
* Mesos is built to handle that, as well as long-lived processes (servers) and short-lived processes as well

# How mesos fits in

* If you're looking for an architecture you can code all of your organization's cluster applications against - not just hadoop stuff - Mesos can be really useful
    - You should also look at kubernetes / docker
* If all you are about is Spark and Storm from the Hadoop-y world, Mesos is an option
    - But YARN's probably better, especially if your data is on HDFS 
    - Spark on Mesos is limited to one executor per slave (node)

# Myriad - Siloed vs Resource Sharing

We avoid carving off a set of database datacenter, and then the rest focused on other services. You might be underutilising your hadoop clusters.

Myriad allows you to use same resources for both hadoop and other

# When to use mesos

* If your organisation as a whole has chosen to use mesos to manage its computing resources in general
    - Then you can avoid partitioning off a hadoop cluster by using Myriad 
    - There is also a Hadoop on Mesos package for cloudera that bypasses YARN entirely
* Otherwise - probably not. I just want you to know what mesos is and how it's different to YARN.
