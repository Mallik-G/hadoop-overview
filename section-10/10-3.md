# Python Challenge

Take the python script we just used, and modify it in a couple of ways:

* Instead of seeing how many URLs are seen, I want to see how many time each HTTP status code has been seen. 
    - There is already a regex status field
* Change the slide interval of the streaming job
    - INstead of using straming interval of 1 second, you want to see the interval every 5 seconds.
