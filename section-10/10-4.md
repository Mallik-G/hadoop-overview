# Apache Storm

* Another framework for processing continuous streams of data on a cluster
    - Can run on top of YARN (like Spark)
* Works on individual events, not micro-batches (like Spark Streaming)
    - If you need sub-second latency, Storm is for you

# Storm Terminology

* A **stream** consists of tuples that flow through
* **Spouts** that are source of stream data (Kafka, Twitter, TCP, etc)
* **Bolts** that process stream data as its received
    - Transform, aggregate, write to databases/HDFS
* A **topology** is a graph of spouts and bolts that process your stream

Spout -> Bolt -> Bolt

# Storm architecutre

* Nimbus - node tracker.
    - Single point of failure
    - But in practice, you can start it back up without loosing anything
    - There is high avialability Storm where you have backups
* Zookeeper
    - Manages jobs
* Supervisor
    - Where work happens with storm
    - They run workers and worker processes

# Developing Storm applications

* Usually done with Java
    - Although bolts may be directed throuh scripts in other languages
    - Most of the times it's java tho... 
* Storm Core
    - The lower-level API for Storm
    - Still pretty simple to use tho!
    - "At least once" semantics
* Trident
    - More popular
    - Sits on top of Storm Core
    - Higher Level API for Storm
    - "Exactly once" semantics
* Storm runs your applications "forever" once submitted - until you explicitly stop them

# Storm vs Spark Streaming

* There's something to be said for having the rest of spark at your disposal
    - integrate with graphX, or MLilib, etc
* But if you truly need real-time processing (sub-second) of events as they come in, Storm is your choice
* Core storm offers "tumbling windows" in addition to "Sliding windows"
* Kafka + Storm seems to be a pretty popular combination
* It does seem to be that spark is getting a lot of momentum, and hence spark streaming

# Let's play

* We'll run the wordcount topology example and examine it.

Spout (Generates random sentence) -> Bolt (splits into words) -> Bolt (Keep count of words and emit results)
