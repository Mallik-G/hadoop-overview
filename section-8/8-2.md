# TEZ Explained

Directed Acyclic Graph Framework

# What is TEZ?

* Another bit of infrastructure you can just use
    - Makes your hive pig or MR jobs faster!
    - It's an aplpication frameworks clients can code against as a replacement for MR
* Constructs Direted Acyclic Graphs, for more efficient processing of distributed jobs
    - Relies on a more holistic view of your job; eliminates unneccessary steps and dependencies
* Optimizes physical data flow and resource usage

# Directed Acyclic Graphs

It shows how it converts a set of MR stages in Pig/Hive, which results in multiple MR jobs.

TEZ might be able to combine the 4 distinct MR jobs and run them as a single set of dependencies, reducing a lot of intermediate steps.

# Where TEZ sits 

YARN is the resource negotiator sthat sits on HDFS

Tez sits at the same level as MR/Spark. Apps at the top can talkk wiht people on top...

# Just tell hive or pig to use it

* It probably does by default anyhow
* It really is a lot faster

It's quantifiably faster! (TEZ site has graphs!)

# Let's try it out!

* Compare performance of a hive query usign Tez vs Map Reduce
