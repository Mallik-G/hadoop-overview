# Oozie

Orchestrating your Hadoop Jobs

More interactive, allows you to chain stuff together

## What is Oozie?

* Burmese word for "elephant keeper"
* A system for running and scheduling Hadoop tasks

# Workflows

* A multi-stage hadoop job
    - Might chain together MapReduce, Hive, Pig, Sqoop, and distcp tasks
    - Other systems available via add-ons (like Spark)
* A workflow is a Directed Acyclic Graph of actions
    - Specified via XML
    - So, you can run actions that don't depend on each other

## Workflow example

* Every workflow has a start and end node
* You can have fork nodes that can kick 1+ actions in parallel
    - Might kick off a pig action and a sqoop node at the same time
    - You could get different datasets at the same time
* Then they can go to a join node, which waits for dependencies to finish
* And then can have hive actions that allow you to do different things 
* Finally it finishes

that would then translate to an XML file using start, fork, join nodes, etc.

# Steps to set up a workflow in Oozie

* Make sure each action works on its own
* Make a directory in HDFS for your job
* Create your workflow.xml file and put it in your HDFS folder
* Create job.properties defining any variables your workflow.xml needs
    - This goes on your local filesystem where you'll launch the job from 
    - You could also set these properties within your XML

# Running workflow with Oozie

* oozie job --oozie http://localhost:1100/oozie -config /home//maria_dev/job.properties --run
* Monitor progess at http://127.0.0.1:11000/oozie

# Oozie coordinators

* Schedules workflow execution
    - Should be done in prod
* Launches workflows based on a given start time and frequency
* Will also wait for required input data to become available
* Run in exactly the same way a a workflow

# Oozie bundles

* New in Oozie 3.0
* A bundle is a collection of coordinators that can be managed together
* Example
    - You might have a bunch of coordinators for processing log data in various ways
        + By grouping them in a bundle you could suspend them all if there were some problem with log collection
