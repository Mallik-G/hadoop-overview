# Zeppelin Overview

Zepplin is in the infrastructure continously running in the background.

Alghouth Zepplin is used to visualise data and slice it, it also has a lot of plugins for cassandra, hbase, etc.

As something that sits on the top spectrum, as it's broad on its scope.

It's hard to explain what zeppelin is, so we'll just put it together.

It makes it easy to visualise your data.

# What is Zeppelin

* If you're familiar with iPython notebooks - it's like that
    - Let's you interactively run scripts / code against your data
    - Can interleave with nicely formatted notes
    - Can share notebooks with others on your cluster

# Spark INtegration

* Can run spark code interactively (like you can in the spark shell)
    - This speeds up your development cycle
    - And allows easy experimentation and exploration of your big data
* Can execute SQL queries directly against SparkSQL
* Query result may be visualised in charts and graphs
* Makes spark feel more like a data science tool!

# Zeppelin can do much more than spark

* There are a lot of interpreters that integrate to spark!
* Has a python backend, so can be like ipython notebook
* Also a pluggable architecture - when visualising data

# It will make more sense if we just play with it

comes pre-installed in hortonworks - let's get started!
