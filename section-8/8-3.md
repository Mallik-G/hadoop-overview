# Configure and run hive

Let's setup a job in hive and compare tez vs map reduce!

Let's open VM and start ambari.

Go to the Hive view.

We should have a movielens database with ratings table.

We're gonna upload the movie table.

The delimeter is a pipe char.

Choose the u.item file, call table names, load into movie lens database, and use the columns: movie_id, name, release_date

Data is in!

# Querying

WE can check that our data is there in the database sidebar.

Now let's start writing a query:

``` sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS topMovieIDs;

CREATE VIEW topMovieIDs AS
SELECT movie_id, count(movie_id) as ratingCount
FROM movielens.ratings
GROUP BY movie_id
ORDER BY ratingCount DESC;

SELECT n.names, ratingCount
FROM topMovieIDs t JOIN movielens.names n
ON t.movie_id = n.movie_id;
```

It currently uses TEZ for default ,but we'll add a property in the gear engine:

We add: hive.execution.engine = tez.

Now that we ahve it, we hit execute and start the clock.

~21 seconds with tez!

Now let's change the execution engine to MR!

And let's now see how long that will take...

And it's finally done after 71 seconds!

There is no reason why not to use tez pretty much!

# More about tez

We can see the tez view!

We can view recent jobs with the DAGs (not the queries)

We can see the counters, graphical view, etc.

We can see it's similar pattern. INstead of having separate MR stages sequencially.
