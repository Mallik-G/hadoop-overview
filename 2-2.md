# Install Movielens dataset

We're gonna start and setup our dataset in our local HDP virtualbox.

We can access the link by going to 127.0.0.1:8080 instead of 127.0.0.1:8888

Login with username: maria_dev and password: maria_dev

We can see all the technologies in the previous lecture.

Now we're gonna talk about HDFS.

We can see how many nodes there are and data nodes.

We can go to files view to see our entire HDFS system.

It would work the same in a real cluster.

Let's go to /user/maria_dev and create a new folder - namely ml-100k

Now upload files from hard drive (the folder we downloaded).

You can see what the files have, download, rename, select files + concat, etc.

Now we've deleted the files.

That's it! Next lecture we'll do it from a command line.
