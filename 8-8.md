# Workflow in Oozie

* We'll get the movielens back into MySQL
* Write a hive script to find all movies released before 1940
* Set up an Oozie workflow that uses sqoop to extract movie information

# Starting

Let's log into our VM!

We're gonna do a Sqoop extract to get the movie info, and then an action to analyse that data with Hive and see movies prior to 1940.

Let's check if we have the data

```
mysql -u root -p
        hadoop
show databases;
```

If we don't have thew data, lets get it

```
wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/movielens.sql

mysql -u root -p
        hadoop

set names 'utf8';
set character set utf8;
create database movielens;
use movielens;
source movielens.sql

show tables;
select * from movies limit 10;
```

Now we're sorted!

Now we're gonna extract it with Sqoop to access it.

But first we need to grant privileges.

```
grant all privileges on movielens.* to ''@'localhost';
```

let's get our hive script next!

```
wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/oldmovies.sql

cat oldmovies.sql
```

# Oozie setup

Now let's get the oozie workflow file

```
wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/workflow.xml
```

The other thing we need is our properties file to run the job with

```
wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/job.properties
```

We need to upload our workflow.xml file to hdfs so oozie can use it.

```
hadoop fs -put workflow.xml /user/maria_dev
hadoop fs -put oldmovies.sql /user/maria_dev
```

In order for sqoop to connect to mysql we need a sqoop-mysql connector:

```
hadoop fs -put /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar /user/oozie/share/lib/lib_20170505125744/sqoop
```

Now let's go on the ambari oozie  view and restart all.

Now we're ready to kick off our oozie workflow

```
oozie job -oozie http://localhost:11000/oozie -config /home/maria_dev/job.properties -run
```

And now if we go to 127.0.0.1:11000/oozie we can see our job!

We can see the DAG, the info, the job definition, the log, the errors, etcc

We can now see our output by going to ambari files view
