# The Hadoop Ecosystem

## Overview

### What is Hadoop?
OS software platform for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large datasets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware

### History

* Google is the elder. They published a paper GFS and MapReduced in 2003-2004.
* Yahoo was building NUTCH, an OS web search engine at the same time
* Hadoop was primarily driven by Doug Cutting and Tom White in 2006
* It's been evolving ever since...

Hadoop is the name of the founder's kid's toy elephant.

### Why Hadoop?

* Data's too big these days - terabytes per day
* Vertical scaling doesn't work
* Horizontal scaling is linear (Not so much with vertical scaling)
* Hadoop: **it's not just for batch processing anymore**
