# HUE
Hadoop user experience

Not as common in hortonworks, but in Claudera YES!!

So there are 2 main competitors for hadoop distributions:

 * Hortonworks
     - Ambari used for management and query / files UI
     - Zeppelin for notebook
 * Cloudera
     - HUE used for query / files UI and notebook
     - Cloudera manager used for management
 * HUE is cloudera's ambari - sort of...

Hue is not the same as ambari... but it's its analog.

Hortonworks is 100% open source. 

Cloudera has some proprietary things.

Cloudera is a bit more popular at the moment!

# Cool things about Hue

* Oozie editor
    - Can create coordinators, workflows, etc
    - Also spark, pig, hive, hbase, HDFS, Sqoop
* Built in notebooks

A bit more of an integrated solution

# It "is" open source

* Not an apache project; maintained by cloudera
* It can be installed in hortonworks, but don't do it... (too much hassle)

# They have a demo!

Let's go to http://gethue.com.

It has a more corporate and polished view.

Let's click in live demo!

They have different samples. In examples we can open the Fork Oozie workflow.

It has a very nice visual interface. You can also coordinate coordinators and bundles.


# Queries

In the query editor for HIVE, we can see it's similar

Let's select one that has been ran.

Does similar stuff that Ambari and Zeppelin do. This is cloudera's answer to Ambari.

It's easier to the eyes - that tends to be the difference between OS and Private backed projects.
