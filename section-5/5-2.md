# Hive Example

We'll start by spawning our Ambari, and loging in with admin.

We want to analyse movie data with Hive. 

We are going to do the same thing from lecture 1. Finding the most popular movie first.

Let's go to the view icon and select HIVE VIEW.

After it runs checks, we can type SQL commands.

First we need data to query.

We might still have some of the data from lecture 1.

Let's remove those:

```
DROP TABLE ratings;
DROP TABLE movie_names;
```

We'll now re-upload the table, and rename the columns to **userID, movieID, rating, epochseconds**, and the names table with the columns **movieID, title**.

# Running query

Now we can run the query, and use views!

```
CREATE VIEW topMovieIDs AS
SELECT movieID, count(movieID) as ratingCount
FROM ratings
GROUP BY movieID
ORDER BY ratingCount DESC;

SELECT n.title, ratingCount
FROM topMovieIDs t JOIN names n ON t.movieID = n.movieID;
```

Now let's clean up by removing the view:

```
DROP VIEW topMovieIDs;
```
