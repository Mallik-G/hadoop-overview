# Presto Cassandra integration

Boot up the terminal, and enable python 2.7

```
scl enable python27 bash

python -V
```

Now we can start cassandra service

```
service cassandra start
```

And we need to enable the thrift server with cassandra.

```
nodetool enablethrift
```

We should check if our database is still there

```
cqlsh --cqlversion="3.4.0"

describe keyspaces;

use movielens;

describe tables;

select * from users limit 10;

quit
```

We have data!

So let's connect it to presto, and then use queries with presto that merges hive with cassandra.

```
cd etc/catalog
```

now we need to configure properties with ```vim cassandra.properties``` and enter:

``` 
connector.name=cassandra
cassandra.contact-points=127.0.0.1
```

Now let's go to our catalog

```
cd ../..
bin/launcher start
```
