# What is Flink

* German for quick and nimble
* Another stream processing engine - most similar to storm
* Can run on standalone clustre, or on top of YARN or Mesos
* Highly scalable (1000's of nodes)
* Fault-tolerant
    - Can survive failures while still guaranteeing exactly-once processing
    - Uses "State snapshots" to achieve this
* Up & coming quickly

# Flink vs Spark Streaming vs Storm

* Flink's faster than storm
* Flink offers real streaming like storm but if you're using trident with storm you're using micro-batches
* Flik offers a higher level API like trident or spark, but while still doing real-time streaming
* Flink has good scala support, like Spark streaming
* Flink has an ecosystem of its own, like Spark
* Flink can process data based on event times, not when data was received
    - Impressive windowing system
    - This plus real time streaming and exactly once semantics is important for financial applications
* But it's the youngest technology

# All three solutions converging

* Spark Streaming's "Structured Streaming" paves the way for real event based streaming in Spark
* Becomes more a question of what fits best in your existing environments

# Flink architecture

* Runtime engine is similar to spark
* It's a runtime engine
* It can run on top of Yarn/hadoop
* Or can run in AWS, or Google Cloud
* And can run a local version at end of lecture
* On top of Flink, not only can a process stream data, but it also can batch data
* It has a datastream API and a DataSet API
    - Stream
        + Table
        + CEP (Event processing)
    - Batch
        + Parallel universe like spark
        + **FlinkML** instead of MLLib
        + **Gelly** instead of GraphX
        + **Table** for SQL queries 

# Connectors

* HDFS
* Cassandra
* Kafka
* Others
    - ElasticSearch
    - NiFi
    - Redis
    - RabbitMQ
