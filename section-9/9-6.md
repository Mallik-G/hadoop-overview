# Setup Flume Flow

* Source listening to directory
* Listening to directory
* Transfer to directory
* Transfer to channel
* Transfer to HDFS Sink
* Put them into HDFS into certain structure

We have 2 terminal windows open.

We're in the home dir

```
wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/flumelogs.conf

cat flumelogs.conf
```

## The file

```
# flumelogs.conf: A single-node Flume configuration

# Name the components on this agent
a1.sources = r1
a1.sinks = k1
a1.channels = c1

# Describe/configure the source
a1.sources.r1.type = spooldir
a1.sources.r1.spoolDir = /home/maria_dev/spool
a1.sources.r1.fileHeader = true
a1.sources.r1.interceptors = timestampInterceptor
a1.sources.r1.interceptors.timestampInterceptor.type = timestamp

# Describe the sink
a1.sinks.k1.type = hdfs
a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.path = /user/maria_dev/flume/%y-%m-%d/%H%M/%S
a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.filePrefix = events-
a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.round = true
a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.roundValue = 10
a1.sinks.k1.hdfs.roundUnit = minute

# Use a channel which buffers events in memory
a1.channels.c1.type = memory
a1.channels.c1.capacity = 1000
a1.channels.c1.transactionCapacity = 100

# Bind the source and sink to the channel
a1.sources.r1.channels = c1
```

* We define the channels
* We create a spooldir
    - We select the folder to monitor
    - Push them into flume and mark them as completed
    - We want to add file headers
    - We want to attach an interceptor 
        + Timestamp interceptor
        + Append the timestamp when they are added
        + We also send the timestamp of when it was dropped
* Sink
    - We store in HDFS
    - Specify the format /%y-%m-%d/%H%M/%S
    - We round the units - we get new subdirs generated for every 10 minutes
    - Because it has timestamp interceptor, we can use it with HDFS sync
* Channel
    - We just add them to the memory channel
    - Assign Sink and source to both

We're first going to create the directory for spool.

```
cd ~
mkdir spool
```

Also make sure our folder exists in HDFS: /home/maria_dev/flume

Now let's start the flume!

```
cd /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker
bin/flume-ng agent --conf conf --conf-file ~/flumelogs.conf --name a1 -Dflume.root.logger=INFO.console
```
