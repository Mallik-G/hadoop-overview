# Setting up Kafka

Kafka is already installed.

So let open ambari dashboard, log in with admin, and start the Kafka server.

Now we can mess with Kafka.

Let's start by ssh-ing to our vm. and run the following

```
cd /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/

cd bin

ls
```

We're gonna start by creating a topic. A stream of data to publish to it, and then consume it

```
./kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper sandbox.hortonworks.com:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic fred
```

Topic has been created

```
./kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper sandbox.hortonworks.com:2181
```

Fred is indeed  in the list of the topics.

Let's publish some data into it.

```
./kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list sandbox.hortonworks.com:6667 --topic fred

This is a line of data
I am sending this on the fred topic
```

This is going to listen to all the stdin and broadcast all the input to the topic.

And we've published 2 topics

Now let's open another terminal to ssh, and consumer the topics.

```
./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server sandbox.hortonworks.com:6667 --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic fred --from-beginning
```

The --from-beginning is giving us all messages from the beginning

Now we can start sending stuff on the producer and see it coming out from the consumer

It's a scalable and reliable mechanism for massive streams.
