# Let's play with HBase

## what are we doing?

* Create HBase table for movie ratings by user
* Then show we can quickly query it for individual users
* Good example of sparse data

HBase is fundamentally row oriented.

Rating data is provided 1 line at a time. We'll write a python script that populates the HBase script. Build a service that can give us back all ratings for user ID.

For UserID, give all ratings for UserID. INdividual movie. Row ID has a UserID Key. 

The column family is the movieID where the value is the actual rating given.

## How are we going to do it?

We'll run a REST service on top of HBase.

So Python Client -> REST Service -> HBase -> HDFS

Python client will be running from Desktop client outside of environment, and the rest will be running from our VM.

## Let's get started!

We forward port 8000 to port 8000, and then login as admin.

We access HBase dashboard and start the service!

Now we need to launch the REST server on top of HBASE.

We ssh to our virtual machine, and super user to root, and run:

```
/usr/hdp/current/hbase-master/bin/hbase-daemon.sh start rest -p 8000 -infoport 8001
```

Now we have a rest server on top of our HBase cluster that can GET, PUT requests to outsider servies.

We have our backend running, so we can use the frontend now.

```
from starbase import Connection

c = Connection("127.0.0.1", "8000")

ratings = c.table('ratings')

if ratings.exists():
    print("Dropping existing ratings table\n")
    ratings.drop()

ratings.create('rating')

print("Parsing the ml-100k ratings data...\n")
ratingFile = open("/Users/MYCOMPUTER/Downloads/ml-100k/u.data", "r")

batch = ratings.batch()

for line in ratingFile:
    (userID, movieID, rating, timestamp) = line.split()
    batch.update(userID, {'rating': {movieID: rating}})

ratingFile.close()

print("Committing ratings data to HBase via REST service \n")
batch.commit(finalize=True)

print ("Get back ratings for some users...\n)")
print("Ratings for user ID 1:\n")
print(ratings.fetch("1"))
print("And 33\n")
print(ratings.fetch("33"))
```

and now to clean up we can type:

``` 
/usr/hdp/current/hbase-master/bin/hbase-daemon.sh stop rest
```
