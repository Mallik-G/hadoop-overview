# Exercise

* You're building a massive stock trading system
* Consistency is more important than anything
* "Big data" is present
* It's really, really important - so having access to professional support might be a good idea. And you have enough budget to pay for it

In this case it seems that we care about consistency above all, and we have huge partition tolerance. We probably would have to go with either MongoDB, or with Cassandra with a reduced node confirmation number to increase consistency.

But it would also not be a crazy choice to use MySQL.. as long as it's sharded in very efficient ways

All things being equal... if you already had a hadoop cluster, maybe HBase woudl be another posibility as it lives right on top of hdfs
