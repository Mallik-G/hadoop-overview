# What is presto?

* Similar to drill
    - It can connect to many different "big data" databases and data stores at once, and query across them
    - Familiar SQL syntax
    - Optimised for OLAP - analytical queries, data warehousing
        + Not for fast transactions
        + Instead its for analysis + people used to SQL
* Developed, and still partially maintained by facebook
* Exposes JDBC, command-line and tableu interfaces

# Why presto

* VS Drill? Well it has a cassandra connector for one thing
* If it's good enough for Facebook
    - "Facebook uses presto Presto for interactive queries against several internal data stores, including their 300PB data warehouse. Over 1000 FB employees use presto daily to run more than 30000 queries that in a total scan over a petabyte each day."
    - Also used by dropbox and airbnb
* A single presto query can combine data from multiple sources, allowing for analytics across your entire organisation
* Presto breaks the false choice between having fast analytics using an expensive commercial solution or using a slow "free" solution that requires excessive hardware

# What can Presto connect to?

* Cassandra (It's Facebook after all)
* Hive
* MongoDB
* MySQL
* Local Files
* And stuff we haven't talked about
    - Kafka
    - JMX
    - PostgreSQL
    - Reddis 
    - Accumulo

# Let's dive in!

* Setup presto
* Query our hive ratings table using presto
* Spin cassandra back up and query our users table in cassandra with presto
* Execute a query that joins users in cassandra with ratings in hive
