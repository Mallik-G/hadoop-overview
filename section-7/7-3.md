# Querying with Drill

Let's start by going to the query tab, and type

```
SHOW DATABASES;
```

We can see stuff like hive.movielens, and mogo.movielens.

Let's use that!

```
SELECT * FROM hive.movielens.ratings LIMIT 10;
```

And that came back fairly quickly - we can see the data through drill. Not HiveQL.

Let's do the same for Mongo

```
SELECT * FROM mongo.movielens.users LIMIT 10;
```

We didn't even bother to setup an index! And it's still working :)

Great.

_id is something that Mongo automatically inserts... Completely un-indexed.

Drill works with mongodb as well.

Now let's tie it all together - when things start getting quite magically! If we wanted we could also join stuff with local files, and HDFS and HBase, etc.

What shall we do... let's break down how many ratings per occupation.

LIst of occupation, and user id correlated, with ratings table with individual ratings.

```
SELECT u.occupation, COUNT(*) FROM hive.movielens.ratings r 
JOIN mongo.movielens.users u
ON r.user_id = u.user_id
GROUP BY u.occupation
```

And that came back!

We can now see each individual occupation, and the users and the number of movies they watch.

It works!

Students watch the largest number of movies...

# Cleaning up

Now let's go back to the terminal and shut down drill

```
bin/drillbit.sh stop
```

And then in ambari, let's shut down mongodb...
