# Installing PRESTO!

Let's install it and use it. Kick off the vm, and ssh.

We'll download the presto tarball

```
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/facebook/presto/presto-server/0.177/presto-server-0.177.tar.gz

tar -xvf presto-server-0.177

cd presto-server-0.177

ls
```

We don't have any configuration at all, which should live in the ETC directory...

It's up to us to create the files!

Let's download the config files that should work out of the box

```
wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/presto-hdp-config.tgz

tar -xvf presto-hdp-config.tgz

cd presto-hdp-config

# This is the port that is open for the virtual box 
# and the container we are running within
cat config.properties

# jvm.config just contains some garbage collection
# log.property sets the log level

# log.properties - important is the log ID
cat log.properties

# the two files here are database connectors
cd catalog
ls

# hive.properties tells it to connect to thrift service where hive runs
# by default
cat hive.properties
```

This should be enough to run presto with hive.

If we setup cluster, we need to make sure we do the files ourselves

But we're not done. We have everything to run the presto server.

But we have no interface.

We need to download the CLI, so we can do it with:

```
cd bin

wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/facebook/presto/presto-cli/0.177/presto-cli-0.177-executable.jar

# And rename it
mv presto-cli-0.177-executable.jar presto

# and executable
chmod +x presto
```

We're at a point where we can launch presto!

```
cd ..

# We should be at home of presto server folder
pwd

# start the server
bin/launcher start
```

After a few seconds we should be able to access the presto web on 127.0.0.1:8090.

Now lets connect using the command line interface:

```
bin/presto --server 127.0.0.1:8090 --catalog hive
```

We assume that we still have the tables in hive. If we don't for some reason, we would just have to re-import the table.

Now lets run presto commands

```
show tables from default;

select * from default.ratings limit 10;
```

IN the dashboard we can see a lot of breakdowns from the queries we have ran.

let's do more complex stuff...

```
select * from default.ratings where rating = 5 limit 10;

select count(*) from default.ratings where rating=1;
```

Whilst doing those queries we can see that the dashboard shows how we run the queries, etc.
