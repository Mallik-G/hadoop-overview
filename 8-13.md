# Other Admin Technologies

Some older systems that you might hear about.

# Ganglia

* Old monitoring system -- distributed monitoring system
    - Developed by UC berkeley
    - Originally widely used by unis
    - Wikimedia/wikipedia used to use it
* Largely supplanted by Ambari / Cloudera manager / Grafana

It's not very pretty...

For back when it was written 10 years ago, it's ok... but now it's bad...

Grafana / Ambari is much nicer.

Ganglia is dead today, but it's good to know it.

# Chukwa

* System for colleting and analysing logs from your hadoop cluster
* Initially adopted by netflix
* Largely supplanted by Flume or Kafka
    - Both are more general purpose
    - Faster
    - Easier to set up
    - More reliable

Chakua is dead as well - hasn't changed since 2010
