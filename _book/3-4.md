# Runing Pig Script

We open up our HDFS on our maria_dev folder.

We now create a ml-100k folder in there.

Once we have all our files sorted, we can go to the PIG view to add the new script.

Copy all the code we wrote in the last lecture and paste it to run it as a pig script - finally click execute.

This brings up a new tab that shows how to execute, and converts everything to map reduce to execute the map reduce jobs under the hood.

After a couple of minutes we got our results!

So we've ran some pig code!

Now, we can make this even faster. We can use TEZ!

TEZ uses a directed acyclic graph to understand all the things we're doing to optimise the order of the operations.

TEZ will break them down to get the best result we want. It finds the quickes path.

We only have to tick the "execute in tez" button.

This finishes in a factor of 10 faster. TEZ integration is relatively new. This is putting PIG again in the front seat. PIG integrated with TEZ is really easy ways to do very complicated analysis. 

PIG + TEZ is a great combination.
