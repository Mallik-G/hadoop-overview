# HDFS: Command line interface 

Some people might prefer using a CLI interface.

Let's open the terminal once the virtualbox is running.

We can connect via ssh using:

```
    ssh maria_dev@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
```

To run any commands we use the prefix command:

```
hadoop fs -
```

an example is

```
hadoop fs -ls
```

To see all my ls files in dir...

In this case we can run ```hadoop fs -mkdir ml-100k``` to create a directory.

We can check if it's there ```hadoop fs -ls```.

So if we want to get data to play with, let's first get the data that is hosted in the instructor's server by running:

```
    wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/ml-100k/u.data
```

Now let's copy the file to ```hadoop fs -copyFromLocal u.data ml-100k/u.data```.

Finally we can clean up:

```
    hadoop fs -rm ml-100k/u.data
    hadoop fs -rmdir ml-100k
```
