# MapReduce: A Real Life Example

The objective of this section is to show an exmaple tackling the question of: **How many of each movie rating exist?**.

And what the distribution of the stars are.

## Making it a MR problem

* We need to assemble mappers and reducers that produce the result that we want
* There are other frameworks like SPARK and HIVE are better than writing raw MR functions

We need to think creatively

Here is the usual strategy:

* MAP: Map each input line to (rating, 1)
* REDUCE: Reduce each rating with the sum of all the 1's

## Writing the Mapper

We're going to use streaming to write in python

``` python
    def mapper_get_ratings(self, _, line):
        (userID, movieID, rating, timestamp) = line.split('\t')
        yield rating, 1
```

THe parameters are:

* self - OO object instance
* _ - this value is often unused, but sometimes it's a key
* line - each input line of data coming in

On a side note on the **yield** keyword:

* It's relevant to iterables and generators
* When you create a list you can read items one by one
* Lists are iterable
* Generators are iterators but you can only iterate over them once - they don't store all values in memory

## Writing the reducer

This then gets passed to the shuffle and sort, so now we only have to write reducer.

``` python
    def reducer_count_ratings(self, key, values):
        yield key, sum(values)
```

## Putting it all together

``` python
from mrjob.job import MRJob # Way to write MR jobs in python
from mrjob.step import MRStep

class RatingsBreakdown(MRJob):
    def steps(self):
        return [
            MRStep(mapper=self.mapper_get_ratings,
                reducer=self.reducer_count_ratigns)
        ]

    def mapper_get_ratings(self, _, line):
        (userID, movieID, rating, timestamp) = line.split('\t')
        yield rating, 1

    def reduce_count_ratings(self, key, values):
        yield key, sum(values)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    RatingsBreakdown.run()
```

The same script might be ran by a streaming job.
